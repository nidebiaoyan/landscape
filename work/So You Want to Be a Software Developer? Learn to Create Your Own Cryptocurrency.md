# So You Want to Be a Software Developer? Learn to Create Your Own Cryptocurrency

## Exploring the World of Cryptocurrency Development

Sanwar Sunny, the CEO of the energy consumption-tracking AI company Dynamhex, has been leveraging blockchain technology for over a decade. Recently, he shared insights with Technical.ly on how to create a cryptocurrency using the programming language Solidity, which powers many blockchain-based products.

### How Blockchain Powers Energy Efficiency

Sunny uses blockchain technology to support his startup, featured on this year’s Baltimore Realist Startups roster. The Ethereum blockchain helps create fungible tokens that verify energy consumption and identify the origin of electricity, as well as its usage. On a practical level, this system allows Sunny to track the exact amount of solar energy produced at a specific time and location.

His company scales this concept to support cities and municipalities by collecting energy consumption and carbon footprint data. These insights enable governments and organizations to develop informed climate action plans.

> “We’re climate action for the Web 3.0 world,” Sunny explained. “I want to ensure my footprint is reduced based on cryptographic verifiability.”

Sunny’s innovative approach essentially turns blockchain technology into a tool for tracking carbon footprints using customized cryptocurrencies.

## Understanding Solidity: The Foundation of Blockchain Development

Solidity, an object-oriented programming language, is specifically designed for creating cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Its unique capabilities make it integral to developing fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for blockchain-powered Web3 applications.

### What Are Fungible Tokens?

Fungible tokens are interchangeable and equivalent—just like physical currencies. Most Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies follow the ERC20 standard, which outlines community-developed rules for interoperability and compatibility with other blockchain products.

#### Leveraging Open Source Libraries

One advantage of developing with Solidity is the availability of open-source libraries on platforms like GitHub. These libraries simplify the coding process by offering pre-built modules. For example, OpenZeppelin, a cybersecurity firm, provides an ERC20 library with security features and standardized functionality.

Sunny's custom "Sunny Coin" was created by calling pre-written functions from these libraries, requiring minimal customization. This streamlined process allowed him to focus on naming the coin and setting its supply while relying on 600 lines of prewritten code from the developer community.

### Tools for Cryptocurrency Development

Developers use tools like Visual Studio for writing code and Remix Ethereum for compiling and deploying their cryptocurrencies. Both tools are freely available, making it easier for new developers to explore blockchain development without significant upfront costs.

## The Power of Freelance Expertise in Blockchain

For developers or businesses looking to dive into blockchain technology, platforms like [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr) offer a wide array of experts who can assist with cryptocurrency creation, smart contract development, and token customization. Partnering with freelancers can save time and provide access to specialized knowledge.

## Conclusion

Blockchain development and cryptocurrency creation offer exciting opportunities for software developers and businesses alike. Whether you’re tracking energy consumption or exploring new applications in Web3, tools like Solidity, open-source libraries, and freelance platforms enable innovation at every stage.
