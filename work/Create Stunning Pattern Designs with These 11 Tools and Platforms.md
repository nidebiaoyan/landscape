## Real-World Applications of Repeated Patterns

Patterns are more than just visual elements—they’re strategic tools to reinforce branding. Here are some inspiring applications of patterns in design:

### 1. **Album Cover Design: BTS’s "Dynamite"**
The repetitive typography on the "Dynamite" album cover uses bold, colorful fonts to grab attention. Even without photos of the band members, the design effectively communicates the energy and vibe of the music.

### 2. **Gift Basket Packaging**
Minimalistic designs with repetitive shapes use white space to highlight the brand name, creating a visually appealing and memorable packaging.

### 3. **Landing Pages**
Landing pages with repeated illustrations (e.g., flowers, icons) create harmony and balance, enhancing the user experience.

### 4. **Book Covers**
Symmetrical typography paired with geometric patterns (e.g., lines and circles) makes book covers visually striking and aligned with the book’s theme.

### 5. **Movie Posters: Spider-Man**
Classic Spider-Man posters use repeated web patterns and bold colors (red, blue, and white) to emphasize the movie’s central theme.

These examples highlight how patterns can elevate a design's aesthetic while enhancing brand recognition.
